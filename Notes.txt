BACKEND:
Superuser:
- Email: bobbyBob@gmail.com
- Password: BreakingPrice

Development:
- inside backend directory
- docker-compose up -d to run the containers

- give permission to save
  - docker-compose exec web bash
  - chown -R 1000:1000 /usr/src/sentigraph_backend/

- install new dependencies, need to rebuild
  - docker-compose up --build
- made changes to files, need to migrate (can do so with entrypoint.sh)
  - docker-compose up -d


Sentiment
- API needs to provide all the data in one go. 
- date in format "90d", need to make relevant change to frontend
  - it can only select last 90d and what not, 90d from when is based
  on the data.

- Do a small chunk first
- sentiment api not working, how to solve
  - Check sentiment analysis is being done
  - Find where the error occurred (possible location is date equality check)
- Need to reset database since many cached data are wrong
- Frontend intergration
  - Date range selection change
  - Aspect & Multiple companies setup, a selector is missing (I think its aspect)

- user's personal list of companies tracked

Admin
- CRUD operation on users
  - read users (Only allow data for user with admin permission)
  - create user
  - delete user
  - update user (need to implement profile page, will use same set of API)
- Implement one operation at a time
  - Implement in the backend
